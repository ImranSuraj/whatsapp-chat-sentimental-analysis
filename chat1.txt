7/31/23, 12:38 - CIT Imran: The paper titled "Text Classification based Behavioural Analysis of WhatsApp Chats" presents a model that performs sentimental and emotional analysis using textual messages and emojis used in WhatsApp chats. The model handles code switching and unifies all texts to a standard form. For each subject, multiple chats are taken, translated, and using a neural network, each sentence and emoji is scored in a dimensional form. The composition of emotions expressed by the subject is defined, and behavioral traits are extracted to determine if the subject likes to use emojis, behaves differently on text according to the person in front of them, and if they are an introvert or extrovert. The paper also discusses the data set, proposed methodology for collection, and key insights and pre-processing of the data. Finally, the paper presents the proposed algorithm for calculating scores for each individual subject, external tools used for multi-classification of emotions, and validity checks performed on the library. The results of the analysis are presented, followed by the conclusion.

8/10/23, 12:04 - CIT Imran: You prepare vader algorithm and how it works
8/10/23, 12:29 - CIT Imran: Here's a brief explanation of how to perform sentiment analysis on WhatsApp chats using the VADER algorithm:

Preprocessing: First, you'll need to clean and preprocess the text data. This involves removing any unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling any special cases like emojis or URLs.

Tokenization: Break down the messages into smaller units called tokens. Tokens are typically words or phrases. This step helps the algorithm understand the text better.

VADER Sentiment Analysis: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text. It assigns a polarity score to each token or sentence, indicating whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. The scores are then combined to calculate an overall sentiment score for the entire message.

Aggregation: After calculating sentiment scores for individual messages, you can aggregate them to get an overall sentiment analysis for the entire chat. This can involve calculating averages or looking for patterns in the data.

Interpretation: Analyze the sentiment scores to understand the emotional tone of the chat. Positive scores indicate positive sentiment, negative scores indicate negative sentiment, and scores close to zero are neutral.

Visualization: You can visualize the sentiment analysis results using graphs or charts to get a clearer understanding of the emotional trends in the chat.
8/10/23, 12:30 - CIT Imran: How vader algorithm works
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis algorithm designed to analyze text and determine its emotional tone. Here's how VADER works:

Lexicon-based Approach: VADER uses a pre-built lexicon (a list of words) that contains information about the sentiment of words. Each word in the lexicon is assigned a polarity score, indicating whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. Some words might also have intensifiers or modifiers that affect their sentiment strength.

Polarity Scores: VADER assigns polarity scores to individual words in the text. Words with higher positive scores are considered positive, while words with higher negative scores are considered negative. For example, "good" might have a high positive score, while "bad" might have a high negative score.

Contextual Valence: VADER takes into account the context in which words appear. It recognizes negations (words like "not" that reverse the sentiment), capitalization, punctuation, and degree modifiers (like "very" or "extremely") that can change the sentiment of a sentence.

Sensitivity to Emojis and Slangs: VADER is designed to handle the kind of informal language often found in social media. It can interpret the sentiment of emojis, emoticons, and common slang words, allowing it to capture the nuances of text in online conversations.

Sentiment Summation: After assigning polarity scores to all the words in a sentence or text, VADER calculates a sentiment score for the entire text. It combines the scores using a formula that takes into account the intensity of the sentiment-bearing words and adjusts for negations and other linguistic features.

Thresholds and Categorization: Based on the sentiment score, VADER categorizes the text into one of four classes: positive, negative, neutral, or compound. The compound score represents an overall sentiment, while the other classes represent the dominant sentiment type.

Rule-Based Adjustment: VADER also has a set of rules to handle cases that might not be accurately captured by the lexicon alone. These rules help fine-tune the sentiment analysis, such as handling repeated letters for emphasis ("soooo good") or handling capitalization for added sentiment.

VADER is effective for analyzing short and informal texts, making it suitable for sentiment analysis in social media posts, reviews, and chats like those in WhatsApp. It's important to note that while VADER is powerful, it might not be perfect for all scenarios, and its accuracy can vary based on the context and language used in the text
